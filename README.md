# 👋 Hi, I'm Darief Maes

MS in Data Science @ Columbia University

I build AI systems that move from research prototypes to scalable, production-ready applications.  
My work spans model training pipelines, backend infrastructure, distributed workers, and polished front-end interfaces that deliver ML to real users.

## 🚀 What I Build

- **End-to-end ML systems:** training, evaluation, inference, and deployment  
- **Backend + distributed infrastructure:** APIs, async workers, pipelines, queues  
- **Full-stack tools:** React/Next.js dashboards for real-world workflows  
- **Applied AI products:** tools used by students, debate teams, and professionals
